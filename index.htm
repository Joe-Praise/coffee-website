            <p><a href="roasting.html">Roasting</a> coffee is particularly popular in Japan and South Korea. There are many popular ways to brew coffee: Boiling Steeping Filtration Methods Pressure Boiling Boiling, or decoction, was the main method used for brewing coffee until the 1930s and is still used in some Nordic and Middle Eastern countries.</p>
            <p>Cowboy coffee" is made by heating coarse grounds with water in a pot, letting the grounds settle and pouring off the liquid to drink, sometimes filtering it to remove fine grounds. While the name suggests that this method was used by cowboys, presumably on the trail around a campfire, it is used by others; some people prefer this method. The above methods are sometimes used with hot milk instead of water.</p>
            <p>Coffee <a href="grinding.html">Grinding</a> The whole coffee beans are ground, also known as milling, to facilitate the brewing process. The fineness of the grind strongly affects brewing.<a href="brewing.html"> Brewing</a> methods that expose coffee grounds to heated water for longer require a coarser grind than faster brewing methods. Beans that are too finely ground for the brewing method in which they are used will expose too much surface area to the heated water and produce a bitter, harsh, "over-extracted" taste.</p>
